# readme file for python file utility

This utility was written to import UTF8 text data from a set of data files.
Data may be exported to CSV format, or viewed as HTML. Metadata about the files
is also provided. The original purpose of script was internationalization test
of web application and Lucene text index.

This script is written in Python 3.1. All imported packages are included with python.
The script should work in Linux or Windows, though 'wc' and 'file' may not work in Windows.

Usage: 
./file_query.py /home/fmalone/Desktop/ --text-size 200 -f html --all

Open the example .HTML data file in a browser for view of output.


Update: file_query seems to be completely functional on my Windows XP machine. Likely due to unix utilities included with Cygwin.

fmalone@H30966 /cygdrive/c/MyPy_home
$ head -1 file_query.py
#!C:\Python31\python.exe

fmalone@H30966 /cygdrive/c/MyPy_home
$ which wc; which file
/usr/bin/wc
/usr/bin/file

# the end
