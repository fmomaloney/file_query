# readme file for python file utility

This utility is designed for QA purposes. The idea is to read metadata and 
unicode into document repository fields for later search, indexing, display 
and sort testing.

 cd existing_git_repo
  git remote add origin git@github.com:fmomaloney/file_query.git
  git push -u origin master
 

# the end
